After 3 years working for each of BP and Deloitte as a developer, data engineer and data scientist, I returned to the world of academia to pursue an MPhil in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge in 2021/22, for which I was awarded a Distinction.

Iâ€™m a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [PhysicsX](https://www.physicsx.ai/) - a deep-tech company of scientists and engineers, developing machine learning applications to massively accelerate physics simulations and enable a new frontier of optimization opportunities in physical design and engineering.
