Originally a Chemical Engineer, I'm a data nerd by vocation and heart. After 3 years working for each of BP and Deloitte as a developer, data engineer and data scientist, I've returned to the world of academia to pursue an MPhil in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge.
